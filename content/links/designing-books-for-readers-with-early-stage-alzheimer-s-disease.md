> Publishers have so far paid little attention to readers who have dementia. The few books that are available tend to be large format, highly illustrated hardbacks with limited text and a strong accent on reminiscence. Books like these may be ideal for shared reading with family and carers ([Bate, 2014](https://designregression.com/article/designing-books-alzheimers-disease#ref:bate-2014)), but anecdotal evidence suggests that experienced readers with a relatively recent diagnosis might welcome more adventurous texts. The research outlined below describes the studies I carried out in order to investigate whether adjusting the design of books could help readers with a memory impairment.

Will look through this to see how it might affect reading from a screen for those with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease.
