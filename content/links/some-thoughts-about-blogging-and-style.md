> One not only wants to be understood when one writes, but also quite as certainly not to be understood. It is by no means an objection to a book when someone finds it unintelligible. —<cite>Nietzsche</cite>

I liked this post on writing one sentence paragraphs (via [Alice](https://www.draliceviolett.com/)), and the advice seems sensible enough – indeed, [I was saying the same thing in 1420](../../posts/writing-great-articles-anatomy-of-a-bbc-news-story/) (annoyingly, I seem to have misplaced a really popular article I wrote around the same time about using tabloid conventions on the web). When you’re writing for work a terse, active style is a must.

Green’s extreme version put me in mind of [the stuff Robin Rendle sometimes writes](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters/), which he likens to using PowerPoint. Each idea is neatly sectioned off, to be considered independently.

Writing here is another thing. I sometimes like a trail of short and long sentences, broken up by a fairly random cast of colons, semi-colons, em dashes or even plain, puritanical commas, forming longer, probably difficult to follow paragraphs. Depends.
