A really thought provoking article on irrational politics — and you're probably thinking of _irrational_ in an entirely pejorative way, but here it means a politics that uses symbols and myths rather than “facts” and arguments. Knausgaard contemplates the appeal of Nazism to Germans in its symbols and philosophical promise to provide simplicity and _depth_, rather than as a response to the collapse of the Weimar Republic, mass unemployment and other economic and historical factors.

It strikes me that — at the very least — we need to understand this rather than see Trump, Brexit and other modern irrationalities simply in terms of a failure of reason.
