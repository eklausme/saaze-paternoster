I know these places that mark Blake’s life well, and they’re all walkable around – which is one of the many things I loved about living in London.

(Worked in [Paul Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paul+St,+London/@51.523987,-0.0863904,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x48761cafbf0635c1:0x2f182388ad7fd780!8m2!3d51.523987!4d-0.0842017) near Blake’s birthplace, and [where he was buried](https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/city-gardens/find-a-garden/bunhill-fields-burial-ground), and lived round the corner from Peckham Rye for a while in Nunhead.)
