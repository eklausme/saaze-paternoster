Ah, the _blokes_. This is perceptive, I think, noting a shift in how the appearance and lingo of achingly traditional power structures – middle class, privately educated men running things – morph over time. Not just in cricket.

I suspect I’m not unguilty of adopting the uniform – skinny trousers, no tie and trainershoes. Alas, no work relationships formed on the golf course.

> How did we get here anyway? Key didn’t actually apply for the job of managing director of English cricket. He was approached by his golf partner, Andrew Strauss. McCullum was approached in turn by Key, having been recommended by Eoin Morgan, who is one of McCullum’s best mates.
