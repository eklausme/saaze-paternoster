This is a great piece that reminded me of my own programming history, which was, with the exception of learning Pascal in A level Computer Science for a few months, limited to these simpler languages. Think Sinclair BASIC and Liquid.

I don’t know enough about programming to accurately describe how, say, C# and Liquid differ conceptually. If I was to give it a stab, I’d say that “portal” languages focus on performing tasks now, and are not concerned with the “how“.

You can do a _lot_ with these limited, expressive, fairly-close-to-English languages. Maggie discusses Apple’s Hypercards, which fuelled [a whole gaming industry in the 90s](https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/the-freedom-to-associate/), while [Inform](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/), the main language for writing [parser interactive fiction](https://www.ifwiki.org/Parser-based_interactive_fiction), consists of statements like this:

    Afterlife is a room. "Fluffy white clouds gather round you here in the afterlife." The Pearly Gates are a door in Afterlife. "The Pearly Gates - large, white, wrought-iron and splendidly monumental - stand above you." Heaven is a room. The Gates are above the Afterlife and below Heaven.

        St Peter is a man in the Afterlife. "St Peter, cheery if absent-minded, studies his celestial clipboard."

        Before going through the Pearly Gates:
            say "St Peter coughs disarmingly. 'If you'd read your Bible,' he says, 'you might recall Revelation 21:21 saying that the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate being made from a single pearl. I really don't know why people keep imagining it like the entrance to some sort of public park - oh, well. In you go.'";
            end the story.

Of course, the original [Football Manager was written in Sinclair BASIC](https://torinak.com/qaop#!manager).

Also makes me think that javascript would have been better – easier to learn and more limited in its scope – as a portal language.
