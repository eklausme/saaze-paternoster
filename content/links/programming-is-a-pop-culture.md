An excellent read on how designers, like developers, favour the whatever-the-new-aesthetic-is over the researched.

> _Pop cultures favour the visual aesthetic of the day._ We all know what sort of aesthetic designers commonly favour. Small, low-contrast text, lots of whitespace, no pure whites or pure blacks (just greys). The details vary with fashion, but each generation of designers has a preferred visual aesthetic. That aesthetic tests poorly; the text is illegible; the layout doesn’t have enough contrast. The information density is so sparse it’s effectively non-existent.

In development, Baldur argues that the current aesthetic favours correctness above all else (so, JSX over HTML and CSS-in-js over CSS); whereas, just a few years ago, we ditched XHTML for the much looser HTML(5).
