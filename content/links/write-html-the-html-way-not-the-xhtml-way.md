I really like Jens’ writing. He understands the – what should be very obvious as it’s the one programming language you cannot omit if you want to publish web pages – importance of HTML, and affords it the consideration normally reserved for javascript and, to a lesser extent, CSS.

Ah, XHTML – I’ll raise your 1.0 `doctype` with a 1.1… When HTML 5 came along sanity, or rather, pragmatism was restored. Jens is right when he observes we still exhibit XHTML habits – I couldn’t use anything but lowercase tags and it would feel very weird not closing a `p`. On the other hand, my hex codes are always uppercase and I was more than happy to drop `/>`

Having said that, this pragmatism cuts both ways. Does it really matter if you retain verbose XHTML habits? I wonder how much is to be gained from paring back your markup, especially compared to, say, using javascript judiciously. Perhaps closing our `p`s instils discipline, or at least the feeling of discipline and order.

But `<input required readonly>` is indeed tersely beautiful. Because HTML isn’t XHTML we get the chance to explore these different syntaxes knowing we’re not going to break anything.
