I really like these posts; partly because where your HTML MVP line falls is interesting (I’d say `h`_n_ needs a smaller `line-height` and nav bar links need some margin/padding), partly because sites like this are fast and really easy to read and mainly because it demonstrates how websites would be built in an ideal world. Start with next to nothing and then add bits and pieces where necessary.
