Just in case you were thinking of using Tidal… Seems to be a sorry tale of a celeb dumping a service pretty quickly. It was then bought by Block, Jack Dorsey’s company and, if Tracy’s review is anything to go by, pretty much left undeveloped.

It’s not cheap and I think it’s perhaps still seen as a high-quality service that offers artists a better deal than Spotify. Obviously, it’s just rubbish.
