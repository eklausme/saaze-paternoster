So the first sentence of the [Levelling Up white paper’s executive summary](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom/levelling-up-the-united-kingdom-executive-summary) is very long, surveying the UK from a Johnsonian perspective. Here’s the first bit:

> The United Kingdom is an unparalleled success story – a multi-cultural, multi-national, multi-ethnic state with the world’s best broadcaster; a vibrantly creative arts sector; a National Health Service which guarantees care for every citizen…

You will of course note that these pillars of the British state were either created by socialist Labour administrations, or [attacked and undermined by Conservative governments; including Johnson’s](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/17/no-final-decision-made-on-bbc-licence-fee-says-nadine-dorries).

That a government purports one thing while doing another is hardly surprising. However, it is at least instructive that this is how Johnson’s government _sees_ the UK; or, more accurately, what it thinks its citizens value. Note that these broadly universal features of the UK are listed _before_ the more traditional Conservative values of charitable giving, personal morality and entrepreneurialism. The sentence ends:

> … charities and voluntary groups which perform a million acts of kindness daily; globally renowned scientists extending the boundaries of knowledge every year; entrepreneurs developing the products and services which bring joy and jobs to so many; and millions of citizens whose kindness and compassion has been so powerfully displayed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
