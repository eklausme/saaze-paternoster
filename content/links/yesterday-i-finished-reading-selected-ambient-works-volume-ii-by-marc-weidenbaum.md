_Selected Ambient Works Volume II_ was one of a handful of albums that got me through the first lockdown and, if it was possible to rank these things, is probably in my top 5 albums of all time.

Never knew it was CD-only. I bought _Vol 1_ and _Analogue Bubblebath_ (III, I think – it’s hard to tell by the packaging) on vinyl, but didn’t rediscover Aphex Twin until _drukQs_.
