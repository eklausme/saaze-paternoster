Obviously, the Starmer response is a complete dullard _lock-em-up-for-longer_.

> Two-thirds of Britons said in a poll that they would support “non-violent direct action to protect the UK’s nature”. But support diminishes in practice. My Twitter feed is filled with users who lionise protesters in Iran and Hong Kong but drip with condescension for climate protesters in Europe. Many people reject the disruption to everyday life. They ask why climate activists don’t instead canvass for the Green party.

Protest is never easy, or popular, when it affects _you_.
