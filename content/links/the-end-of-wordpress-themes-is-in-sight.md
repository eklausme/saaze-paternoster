Ben foresaw WordPress becoming a simpler, more standardised CMS where themes disappeared and users tweaked a few typographical options:

> …I wonder if the stylesheet aspect of themes will also be consumed into core and themes will be deprecated. Stylesheets will be relegated to selecting fonts, and colours; and setting sizes and spacings. Gutenberg will take care of the layout. This could easily be done by a plugin or in core directly. There are definite benefits to doing this from a user’s perspective – they will have full control of their site – but it’s going to result in some very boring website layouts.

Of course, this hasn’t happened – yet – but it strikes me as a good idea.

At the moment, WordPress editors [create pages by selecting blocks and shifting them around the page](https://gogutenberg.com/blocks/) – a block can be something like an image, prose, table, button or gallery. The WordPress core handles this system, which is called Gutenberg. But every WordPress site also needs a theme, a presentational layer that sits above whatever the website editor has created with Gutenberg. This makes for a complicated system – theme authors have to account for Gutenberg’s HTML while editors have to check a theme works with however they’re using Gutenberg.

Ben is envisaging a system without the theme layer. Instead, editors would use Gutenberg to create content blocks, but also handle their appearance via settings within the WordPress core. This is similar to the ideal, theme-free blogging CMS I outlined. The UI might be similar to something like Firefox or Safari’s reader modes.
