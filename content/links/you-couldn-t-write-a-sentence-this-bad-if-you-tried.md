I can write very bad sentences, so I won’t comment on that. But this is a nice co-incidence: I really like the Lit Hub site, and it’s linking to a website by Adam Cadre who, completely independently, I’ve followed for more than decade as he’s big in another area I’m interested in, interactive fiction.

(He’s the author of the wonderful if slightly saccarine [_Photopia_](http://adamcadre.ac/if/photopia.html) and the thoroughly nasty [_Varicella_](http://adamcadre.ac/if/varicella.html). [_9:05_](http://adamcadre.ac/if/905.html) is a good starting point.)
