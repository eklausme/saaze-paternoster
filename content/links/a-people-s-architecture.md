Hard to believe, but the UK was once a country where the state built well-designed housing, and there was disagreement over what form of modernism it should take.

Quite liked this on Blair, too:

> Blair, she noted, was insistent that a decent education couldn’t be ‘delivered’, to use the parlance, in older buildings – an argument that Harwood noted was, strangely, never applied to private schools. Blair was of course educated in the enormous Gothic pile of Fettes College, Edinburgh.
