This is thoroughly depressing, but something I’ve luckily managed to avoid as I don’t really use Facebook for anything.

> I guess here is the critical point: if you create a community where neo-Nazis and other far-rightists are welcome, very soon you’ll find you have a community that is ALL neo-Nazis and the far right.

I suppose this is also how these ideas seep into the mainstream.
