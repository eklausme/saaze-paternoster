Build websites, not apps:

> Websites have morphed into applications over time. Not something I am entirely happy about, but I suppose the web was always going to head in that direction after [Web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0). Everyone would want to be the _owner_ of a _platform_. I would go so far as to say there’s a certain kind of power trip or an ego boost from yelling at offline people, “Hey! I run a community.”
