How long has shite like <cite>Location, Location, Location</cite>, <cite>Homes under the Hammer</cite>, <cite>A Place in the Sun</cite>, <cite>Escape to the Country</cite> and <cite>Grand Designs</cite> been peddled to us? Apart from anything else, what an utter lack of imagination our TV diet betrays.

I’m half joking when I suggest the solution to the problem of second home ownership is for the state to compulsoraly purchase and fix up all properties that are not lived in by their owners, to be rented at a nominal sum. Over time, it’d cost less than the tens of billions paid every year to landlords for mold-ridden flats.
