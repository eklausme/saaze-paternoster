No. WordPress is undoubtedly a good web citizen, encouraging us to publish to our own websites. In a small way it helps free us from Facebook and Twitter, improving discourse on the internet and IRL. It’s also saved RSS.

But WordPress is not Matt Mullenweg. The last thing the internet needs is a mentor-sporting, cod-philosophical, übermensch techbro saviour, or absurd hagiographies to them.

We need more faceless, anonymous, communally owned platforms and technologies.
