When _The Guardian_ takes darts seriously you know it’s finally achieved the status of a “real” sport:

> It is a sport with so many momentum shifts it could be played on a seesaw. And at the highest levels, when players throw for a leg or set or match every 90 seconds or so, darts becomes almost a combat sport. True, an opponent cannot hit. But they can constantly wound.

Darts was very popular in the 1980s, and I remember watching Ipswich’s very own Keith Deller winning the BDO World Championship against Eric Bristow in 1983, along with millions of other viewers. Like snooker, its popularity declined soon after, and I’d suggest this is largely down to Thatcherism. Darts wasn’t aspirational – it’s hard to envisage first-generation undergraduates
