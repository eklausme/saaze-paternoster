This is a charming, deeply-researched post (via [Baldur Bjarnason](https://notes.baldurbjarnason.com/)) that explains the who, what, when and why of the current default browser hyperlink blue, #0000EE.

Unsurprisingly, the choice of blue was not an aesthetic decision. It was based on solid, accessible principles – #0000EE contrasts clearly against a white background, and remains distinct for users who are colour blind.

> We conducted approximately 20 empirical studies of many design variables which were reported at the Hypertext 1987 conference and in \[an\] array of journals and books. Issues such as the use of light \[_sic_ – dark blue only becomes a standard by around 1991\] blue highlighting as the default color for links, the inclusion of a history stack, easy access to a BACK button, article length, and global string search were all studied empirically.

A lot of modern web design no longer aims to provide usable, accessible interfaces. Instead, it’s become an exercise in branding and marketing, even if we can now refer to [a set of heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) that save us a lot of thinking around UI.

Anyway, in the spirit of celebrating the history of web design, I periodically use the old-fashioned, international default browser blue as an accent colour. I guess I’m also making an indirect point.
