This is great (via @shampshire) on how Wilgoose upped sticks, went to Berlin and created an album. Loads of interesting ideas – creation on the hoof, Berlin’s slavic, sandy, swampy roots, found sounds, Berlin as a promethean, unsettled city, and its beautiful green areas.

I do remember all the sandy play parks around Zionskirche.
