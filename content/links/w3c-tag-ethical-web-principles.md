I’m surprised this document (via [@frontenddogma](https://frontenddogma.com/)) doesn’t exist in some form already. While you could argue it’s not the W3C’s job to do ethics, I’m grateful. The corporate web has become too innured to scuzzy – and unproven – marketing techniques; this could provide anyone who wants to argue for privacy, transparency and accessibility on their websites a bit more ballast.
