I liked this [note on how difficult it is to ever complete a nonfiction book](http://richardcarter.com/newsletter/painting-the-forth-bridge/), which I think you could apply to _any_ creative work:

> One of the dubious delights of writing nonfiction (or _factual writing_, as I prefer to think of it) is its _undefinitiveness_. Even if you’ve said everything that needs to be said on a topic, inevitably [new facts emerge](http://richardcarter.com/sidelines/new-facts-emerge/) to make your former thoughts out of date, or, at the very least, in need of modification.
