Yes, although perhaps Shopify hive off usability, IA, typography etc. to other specialists. However, a good front-end developer necessarily works in a unique area, where code, logic and “softer” skills intersect. And they’ll be better at some than others.

> In order to become a better frontend developer you don’t become a backend developer, you become a better designer and advocate for the user.

Also worth noting that non-techie people see front-end development in the same way as programming in Fortran.
