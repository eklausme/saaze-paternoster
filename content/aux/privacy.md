## Collecting and storing your data

I don’t collect or store any data about you.

## Third-party services

I don’t use an analytics service (such as Google Analytics) to track behaviour on this site. Nor do I use a screen recording service, such as Hotjar. I don’t use any social media tracking pixels. The only other third party services I use are:

- Bunny Fonts if I’m serving a 3rd party font (which I’m not at the time of writing). Bunny Fonts’ [privacy statement](https://bunny.net/privacy/) says they collect no personal data and are GDPR compliant.
- [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) to collect comments posted on other sites, such as [micro.blog](https://micro.blog). These are stored on the webmention.io servers. This is public data anyway, and I don’t “backlink” to external comments.

If you have any questions email mail@thisdaysportion.com
