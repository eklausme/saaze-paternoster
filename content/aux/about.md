I’m Leon, and <cite>This day’s portion</cite> is my personal blog. There’s also a [website for the professional me](https://www.leonpaternoster.com).

I write about lots of subjects – mainly designing and building things online, but also politics, books, music and other cultural _stuff_, and where these crossover.

I used to post everything to [leonpaternoster.com](https://www.leonpaternoster.com), but that’s now just where you find the work me. I still _believe_ in blogging and, at the very least, writing and hitting publish is good for me.

## About this site

This site is built using a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). [Traditional static sites](https://www.leonpaternoster.com/posts/static/) (as opposed to [single page applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)) do all the heavy lifting of building web pages _before_ a person visits them. This means they’re fast and stable as they’re served “as is” and complete.

You can [browse the code on Github](https://github.com/leonp/thisdaysportion). I used to have a comments system and displayed webmentions – if you’re interested in setting these up on your site the code is still there.

## This day’s portion?

Ambitious (tone – declamatory):

<q>Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day.</q> <cite>– Exodus 16:4</cite>

And personal, referential (also declamatory):

<q>Little boys are taking over: they mumble through the grass. They are not fit to be in the company of vulperines and wolverines. Too many heads knocking about. Service! This day’s portion.</q> <cite>– Service</cite>, The Fall.
