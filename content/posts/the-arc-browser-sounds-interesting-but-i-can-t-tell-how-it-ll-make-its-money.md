I’ve read a couple of [glowing reviews of the new Arc browser](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/12/08/whats-good-about-the-arc-browser/). So, naturally enough, I thought I’d take a look.

Alas, I can’t simply download [Arc](https://arc.net/), despite its invitation to “Try it for yourself”. No. Instead, I’ll have to [provide the makers of Arc – whoever they are – with my email address](https://browserco.typeform.com/to/l9lYbJtU) and wait until my “spot is ready and waiting”. I guess [my name’s not down I’m not coming in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguP14GMrCA).

Still, according to the page’s `title`, I’m going to “Help us build a better internet”, which is nice.

(Also: [using Typeform for the form](https://a11y.reviews/#typeform)? You can build a cutting edge browser, but you can’t mark up an accessible form?)

Chris Coyier refers to Chrome’s fundamental problem: it exists to feed Alphabet’s bottom line. Its good or bad UX ultimately results from that purpose. It’s great that a browser can look at the experience from a new angle, but the question remains: what’s the motivation behind the company and [how will it pay the bills](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/12/08/whats-good-about-the-arc-browser/)?

> You have to have an Arc account to use Arc. That feels a little forceful, but I get it. At some point, this company is going to have to make money, and I’m sure it’s going to have something to do with having an account.

I feel that “something” is doing some heavy lifting. As far as I know, The New York Browser Company will have to make money by either charging for its product (which is fine) or by monetising its users’ data (which isn’t).

There’s nothing on [the company site](https://thebrowser.company/) about its financial model. [_Lots_ of stuff about _intensity_](https://thebrowser.company/values/) and folksy tales of driving with one’s father, though. There is a list of its investors:

> We’ve raised over $17 million dollars from a diverse group that includes the founders of Instagram, Stripe, Twitter, Zoom, Figma, and LinkedIn.

Hmm. Them again.

At a time when we’re questioning the whole financial model of the internet and experimenting with not-for-profit, ground-up alternatives, I think these are important questions. The browser is the software through which we experience the internet – its manufacturers have incredible power. I’d be more comfortable if Arc wasn’t trying to hook me with tacky marketing and told me how it’ll make its money.
