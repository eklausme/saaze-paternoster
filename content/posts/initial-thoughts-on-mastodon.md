I’ve been fairly active [in the fediverse today](https://fosstodon.org/web/@leonp). On the whole, I’ve enjoyed it, and it feels like something is brewing. I reckon around 10% of my Twitter world has some form of Mastodon presence, and people are definitely posting there.

As everyone is posting something on Mastodon, here’s my twopenneth…

- The initial choice of an instance seems very important. Most instances cater for a specific interest, political perspective etc. This could be both limiting and liberating: on one hand, what if I make the _wrong_ choice; for example, if it turns out I’m more interested in web development than politics. On the other, my identity is set at this point and I get to be part of a world I’m interested in – off I go.
- What if my instance gets blocked through no fault of my own?
- There’s something ironic about being free to join any server and finding “likeminded” folk, and then being pigeonholed by your server choice. A [handle]@twitter.com name expresses nothing beyond whatever handle you choose, but leonp@communists.lol says a lot more. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.
- What’s to stop some Mr big/a bunch of venture capitalists setting up a huge, well-resourced, “neutral” Mastodon instance that becomes the new, de facto Twitter? Include cross-federated search. Seems worth speculating a few million on…
- Is federation a panacea for Twitter’s ills? In some ways I think it is: without a single, shared space, it’s a lot harder to spread disinformation without being cut off from the social sphere. Small is good in this respect.
- But… Mastodon is essentially a Twitter clone: there are follower counts, retweets, likes etc. I can already see the same web development hierarchies forming across instances on Mastodon, through what’s being boosted, #followfriday lists etc. This has made me appreciate [micro.blog](https://micro.blog)’s approach to the psychology of social media: it’s a far more democratic space because I have no idea how many followers anyone has. And I predict for that reason it won’t benefit as much from Twitter and Facebook’s demise.
- Also, you’ll still be performing the check-my-phone-every-two-minutes-for-boosts-and-replies dance that you did on Twitter. This is still insane.
- The Guardian should set up an instance.
- I’ve read a couple of articles that say it’s somehow “lazy” to moan about the difficulties of joining the fediverse. I think there’s some truth in this: it’s really not that difficult to set up an account and find people to follow. However, I think this also downplays the strengths of a single platform. How do talented journalists and academics find their audience or even establish a career without Twitter? How do I find them if I need to know which Mastodon instance they’re signed up to? (Cross-federated search again…) Convenience is not a sin in and of itself.
- I still think it’s better for me (and philosophically) to post to your site and then syndicate to social media, whether that’s Twitter, micro.blog or Mastodon. However, I feel less grubby replying on micro.blog or Mastodon (nothing to do with who’s responding, just the platform owners).

Are you using Mastodon? What do you reckon? It does _feel_ like something new is happening out there. And how long before it all collapses in on itself?
