It’s been a while since I last served this site <i>sans</i> styles, but it seemed more apposite than ever this year.

9 April is [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/2022.html)!

(PS – no, the site’s not broken – you can do all the things you normally do – and styling will be resumed tomorrow.)

(PPS – perhaps navigation links should be placed in an unordered list after all.)
