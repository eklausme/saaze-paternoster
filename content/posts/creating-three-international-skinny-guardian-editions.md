[Skinny Guardian](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz) was initially an experiment in getting Jekyll to publish a static site using external data, while producing a paper that I would find easy to read online. As I’m not particularly interested in US or Australian articles, I filtered them out.

However, it’s easy to grab a list of articles filtered by production office, so, in the interests of making it more useful, you can now read [UK](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz), [Australian](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz/au) and [US](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz/us) editions.

The real challenge was figuring out a site structure and navigation that:

* allows you to easily choose an edition
* makes it clear which edition the article you’re reading belongs in
* presents a home page that lists articles rather than a choice of editions
* uses space efficiently on a mobile

I _think_ the flag navigation and choice of a default, UK edition works well. If you’ve got any feedback, just leave a comment.
