Really, I have little interest in chatGPT, or AI in general. Even the AI science fiction I read as a teenager left me cold ‚Äì for some reason, my reaction to a machine becoming sentient and devouring its human progenitors wasn‚Äôt <i>My god how terrifying</i> or <i>How ironic</i>, but <i>So what?</i>, a <span role="img" aria-label="Shrug">ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span> ‚Äì <i>how could you let that happen?</i>

I only note that our latest dystopia has, unlike its predecessors, dispensed with the na√Øve, optimistic ‚Äúwe can use this technology to lead lives of leisure and learning‚Äù phase and headed straight to the end of days main course. And this only reflects 44 years of <i>[there is no alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative)</i>, our failure to summon the will to argue the toss with it, or conceive that what some Silicon Valley dude says isn‚Äôt necessarily the way things are and will forever be.

What I do find interesting is AI‚Äôs inverse ‚Äì when humans communicate in a way that seems like AI. After all, this is a two way street, a process of give and take between man and machine.

Perhaps the most obvious example we can find is when we chance upon an article that has been written to be findable by a search engine. As a fully signed-up human being, you can _feel_ it: the repetition of keyword phrases, the headings posed as questions, the headings for headings‚Äô sake. All the fucking headings. We feel cheated. It can also seep into our more formal work dealings with each other, when we have a meeting with a certain number of people, especially when a fair proportion of them are senior. Often, the words are there, but they become detached from meaning, a semaphore of acronyms and clumsy phrases, signifying we understand the (language) game we are involved in, but little else.

If AI does mean we automate writing for machines, then that‚Äôs not a bad thing ‚Äì if we start writing for humans.

If you write the keyword-laden babble for *Emily‚Äôs Scrummy Kitchen*, or monetised blog posts angling for answerboxes, or bludgeon-headed  political takes that go viral every weekday, or flatly competent student essays, or little inspirational poems in lowercase, or absolutely anything to do with cryptocurrency ‚Äî if your writing can be done by a  machine because it is already machinelike‚Äîthen ChatGPT will take your  job. If you do screenplays for Netflix, it may have already done so. <cite>[Sam Kriss ‚Äì A user‚Äôs guide to the zairja of the world](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/a-users-guide-to-the-zairja-of-the)</cite>

That does perhaps leave Google in a bind. As the creator of machine algorithms that analyse machine generated language, at some point search engine results will presumably devour themselves, becoming completely detached from human intent and meaning, a form of minimalist poetry. _That_ would be artificial intelligence, your AI irony.
