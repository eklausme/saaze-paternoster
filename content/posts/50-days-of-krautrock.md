I was a middleaged Krautrocker.

Here’s Julian Cope on rediscovering the high magic again and again:

> …in 1984, when I met my then new manager Cally, a Krautrock disciple supreme: and most recently since 1991, when my guitar tech Rizla Deutsch put <cite>Neu 2</cite> on in the tour bus. Here we go again, I thought, and here we surely have. — <cite>Julian Cope, [Krautrocksampler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrocksampler) §Introduction</cite>

I had a similar experience with [Neu!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neu!) the other day. I listen to a *ton* of Krautrock, but Hallogallo – which I’ve heard hundreds of times – somehow cut through as something startlingly (ahem) new – alien, <i>sui generis</i>. I wonder if this is everyone’s experience of the first time they hear it? (Actually, it’s more likely to be <i>What’s wrong with my phone?</i> as it takes *ages* to fade in.)

Anyway, this got me thinking it would be fun to rediscover this music, perhaps through this blog. A 100 days of… challenge, perhaps? But what to choose? Where to start?

In <cite>Krautrocksampler</cite> Cope shares his top 50 albums, so why not listen to each one in turn? There’s a few I haven’t heard in there, and 50 days of… is more achievable.

That does mean starting with <cite>[Paradieswärts Düül](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradiesw%C3%A4rts_D%C3%BC%C3%BCl)</cite> by Amon Düül I, which I remember as being _OK_ rather than out of this world. But this should be a voyage of (re)discovery, nein?
