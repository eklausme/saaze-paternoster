I’m sure this has been noted before, but part of Wordle’s charm is that it’s just a website.

There is no Wordle app. To play it, you visit a web address.

To share your game there’s no granting an app or website access to your Twitter or Facebook account. And you can [share it wherever you like, including your own website](/paternoster/notes/wordle-215-6-6) – sharing doesn’t equate to posting to a social media platform.

All the social functionality you’ll ever need – that is, copy and paste, just made more convenient than normal. The perfect open, indie game.
