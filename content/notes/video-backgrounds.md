TIL: you can add a background gradient to the HTML video element. This is great if you don’t have a cover image (see [an example](../../posts/view-transitions-erm/)), and you could even use a media query to change your gradient to match your site theme in dark mode. (`video` is criminally underused: it’s easy to make responsive and offers all sorts of controls via its attributes. YouTube’s fault, I guess.)
