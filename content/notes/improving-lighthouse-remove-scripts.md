Been doing a lot of work to improve the work website’s performance. The two most obvious improvements you can make are to remove hero carousels and big third-party scripts. Even defering scripts/setting them to fire after everything else in GTM doesn’t improve your Lighthouse score that much (not that better Lighthouse scores are necessarily directly related to better performance).
