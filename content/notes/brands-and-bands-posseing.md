I agree with Michael â€“ ideally, [a band should post to a website first and point fans there](https://infosec.exchange/@mharleydev/109596958585176687). Establish a more immediate relationship (probably through signing up for a newsletter), and syndicate to whatever platforms you like.

Most bands probably run their own web presence and use what they know. But then you have the problem of the platform losing traction, or even disappearing.
