I’m happy with the how the [FALL LYRICS IN CAPS](https://botsin.space/@FALLLYRICSINCAPS) bot autoposts from an RSS feed to micro.blog and Mastodon, but it’s just not random enough. A few lyrics appear more often than others from a [bank of 109](https://github.com/leonp/fall-lyrics-in-caps/blob/main/_data/songs.csv). Not sure whether to create a kind of sequence or make it somehow more random using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).
