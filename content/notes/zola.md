I know I only talk about The Fall and running websites, but I may have found an SSG that meets a lot of my [new CMS requirements](../../posts/some-notes-on-moving-from-jekyll-to-either-kirby-or-wordpress/):

✅ single executable (no dependencies)

✅ inbuilt external data fetching (for webmentions)

Plus:

✅ compiles quickly

✅ similar templating to Liquid: easy to migrate

I really like Kirby, but it is a lot of work moving to it.
