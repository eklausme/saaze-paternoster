Couple of post ideas for this weekend, should I find the time (I do have something else to get written and an ITFC match to go to). — Some ideas for reading research (bottoming out line length, leading, type of screen, purpose of the research, who you’re researching etc.) A final run at my response to [Mary Dyson’s article](https://designregression.com/article/line-length-revisited-following-the-research). — Four things I learned from validating my website. A response to [Jens’ article on the types of HTML we write](https://meiert.com/en/blog/the-ways-of-writing-html/) and the importance he places on validation. What you gain from validating, and the _why_ (of course).
