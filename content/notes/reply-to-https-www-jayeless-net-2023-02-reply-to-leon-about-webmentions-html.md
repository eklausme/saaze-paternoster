Thanks Jessica. I think the problem lies in the microformat spec and documentation being unclear, which in turn will lead to inconsistent implementations of webmentions. You’d hope the markup itself didn’t matter, and there was a clearer hierarchy of class names, for example (`h-entry` is fine, but how does `h-card` work with descendants? Indiewebify suggested adding `h-card` to several elements, and nesting spans seems odd). As I think you’ve also found, it’s a bit trial and error.

Still, here we are, conducting a conversation on our websites via webmentions.
