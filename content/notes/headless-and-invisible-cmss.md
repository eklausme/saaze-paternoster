I want my [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) replacement CMS to be as invisible as possible, which means I just want a web interface for adding Markdown files to my repo. Forestry’s strength was that it looked at your site’s content structure and exposed it in a web interface: nothing to install or configure. #cms #headless #static
