The Guardian’s [Open Platform API](https://groups.google.com/g/guardian-api-talk/c/zVyRUx7eEjM) is currently down, which means [https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz) isn’t updating at the moment. (It’s actually been down since 21 December, but this being Xmas/New Year/me being on holiday I haven’t really looked into it until today.)
