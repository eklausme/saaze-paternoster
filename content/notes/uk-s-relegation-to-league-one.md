Slightly disconcerting seeing a few of my international RSS feeds popping up with _Sorry to see what’s happening to the UK_ posts. Does it look that bad from outside? Are we that much of a basket case?

We’re OK! Think of this as the end-game of Thatcherism – a parody; neoliberalism eating itself. Of course, that doesn't mean it won’t be hugely damaging.
