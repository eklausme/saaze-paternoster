Been fillling my boots with free, out of copyright eBooks from Standard eBooks. These are better than Gutenberg as the typography is good (for a start, you get â€œ rather than straight quote marks).

Good range of classics (Origin of the Species, Communist Manifesto, Dickens, Lovecraft etc.) as wll as some more interesting stuff.
