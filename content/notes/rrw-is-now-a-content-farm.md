TFW you remember a website from 10+ years ago and it was (maybe) really good. Then you Google it and it is still there, somehow, but itâ€™s been bought out several times and is now an SEO content farm.

I give you ReadWriteWeb: [https://readwrite.com/](https://readwrite.com/) (cf delicious). At least I _think_ it was pretty good a long time ago.
