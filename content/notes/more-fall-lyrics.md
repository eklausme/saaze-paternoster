Added 30 or so more lyrics to the Fall Lyrics in Caps bank, so there are now 137. It’s quite a nice way to work through a hangover. Today’s themes: computers, Kafaka-esque states, often combined. I should start tagging these entries.

I also think I saw Theme from Error Orror! played live at Essex Uni on 24 Mar 1990.
