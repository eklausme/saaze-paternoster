Not sure what I think about [the House of All](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/feb/02/mark-e-smith-fall-members-house-of-all-martin-bramah). On one hand, they’re talented musicians, Bramah’s a good frontman, so why not form a band? SHanley was very poorly treated. But I don’t know, trading on The Fall’s name. It’s a bit odd. Might listen 🤷‍♂️
