I spent an hour or so exploring the possibility of creating a trad comments system using webmentions (i.e. fill in a form with your name and comment and submit it to a webmention endpoint, rather than getting the commenter to publish something on a separate website). Alas, no, but it would be very cool if webmentions could parse form `input` `name`s to enable this 🤷‍♂️.

C’est vendredi.
