> Not everyone has the privilege to quit Twitter. Not everyone has the spoons to set up an account on the Fediverse in addition to their Twitter presence. But many of us do, if we’re being honest with ourselves.

I think that’s true of a lot of people working in web or academia. If you’re not doing it now, when would you?
