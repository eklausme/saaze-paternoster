A while back I wrote about [how great traditionally static (not SPAs or jamstack) sites are](../../posts/static/). Iâ€™ve had the work site go down a couple of times in the last month and I do think for small or medium size orgs on a small budget, these are a very good thing indeed. At the very least they keep small web teams sane.
