I went to a football match with 21,000 other people today. It was a pretty emotional experience, but this image kept with me most of all. It’s Town defender Toto Nsiala praying with new signing Rekeem Harper (at least I think that’s him; they were quite a long way away and I’ve not seen him before), about 30 minutes before kick off (and apologies for the quality!)
