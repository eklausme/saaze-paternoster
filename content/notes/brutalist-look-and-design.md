[Colin writes on brutalism in web design](https://colinwalker.blog/?date=2021-09-18#p1):

> This site is predominantly text (with the occasional image, video or audio file) but there are some JavaScript flourishes and features to give things a little movement and character… what harm are they doing beyond adding just a few kB to the total payload?

Which is right. I’ve been down the brutalist/minimalist rabbit hole many times, and, while fun, it’s pretty pointless. In the scheme of things, serving pages of 100kb probably makes you lighter than 95% of the rest of the web – adding 32kb of minimised, gzipped jquery is not a crime. (Incidentally, [using jquery is more efficient than React, Angular <i>et al</i>](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-04-21-the-cost-of-javascript-frameworks/).)

Where does web _design_ as a discipline sit alongside architecture, furniture design, landscape design etc? I think there’s a relatively banal interpretation of brutalism which produces kitsch looking websites that make a nod to [how brutalist architecture can jar](/paternoster/posts/yale-school-of-art-school/) – I think this is what Colin is objecting to. But viewing brutalism as an _approach_ to designing websites could be more fruitful, as the web’s materials are inherently fluid, responsive, distributable and plastic. Working _with_ the web’s grain could help produce more accessible web pages. What aesthetic – if any – would that approach result in?
