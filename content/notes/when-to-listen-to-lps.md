I’m _fairly_ keen to start my [50 day Krautrocksampler LP challenge](../../posts/50-days-of-krautrock/), but I’m faced with the problem of time. The last time I read a lot was when I commuted between Ipswich and Colchester, many years ago – I kind of agree with _that_ [article about liminal spaces](https://fortune.com/2023/02/02/remote-work-why-do-i-miss-commuting-psychological-detach-recovery-liminal-space-management-study/) (with the caveat that commuting with Greater Anglia is a fucking nightmare and I don’t want to spend 5 days a week in the office).

To find time… listening while working probably means I don’t give my full attention to the music. The journey to the gym is only 20m at most. Time to put the laptop away.
