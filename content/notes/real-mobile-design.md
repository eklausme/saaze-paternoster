Planning a series of articles on designing work sites for mobiles — 1. Set up a local server and view the site on a phone rather than your desktop, 2. Avoid complex, resource-heavy UI (carousels!), 3. Avoid stuff like box-shadow 4. Don’t be afraid to put things next to each other and use available space. 5. Report on performance and use lingo such as “mobile” and “desktop”. Some of it’s counter-intuitive.
