I’m on leave, so naturally enough I’ve done some work on my website. I’ll stop short of calling it a _redesign_, but I have _rebuilt_ my CSS – more custom properties, less unused classes. Next – I want to pull figure captions into the right margin, just like in the book that’s influenced the typography and structure this time round.
