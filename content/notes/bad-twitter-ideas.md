> â€¦ Musk said he planned to grow revenue by developing new features such as charging for embedding or quoting popular tweets, [said Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/musk-told-banks-he-will-rein-twitter-pay-make-money-tweets-sources-2022-04-29/). This would involve charging a fee when a third-party website wants to quote or embed a tweet from verified individuals or organisations. - [_The Guardian_](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/29/elon-musk-sells-almost-4bn-worth-of-tesla-shares-after-twitter-deal)
