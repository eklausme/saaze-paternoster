A sign of good quality HTML/CSS is how easy it is to edit in order to change things like font size, line height, font family etc.

So if I want to change the main font family using Stylus, it shouldn’t take much more than editing `html {font-family: "Nice New Font"}` or `--primary-font: "Nice New Font"`

I could be watching Eurovision, but I’ve only liked the Austria song so far, and they went first.
