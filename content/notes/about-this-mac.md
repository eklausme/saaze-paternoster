One very good thing about Macs is how much life you get from them. This bottom-of-the-range Air is more than seven years old and has only 4GB RAM, but it runs all my daughterâ€™s Office school programmes and builds my website. It upgraded to Big Sur with no problems and still lasts around seven hours on one battery charge.
