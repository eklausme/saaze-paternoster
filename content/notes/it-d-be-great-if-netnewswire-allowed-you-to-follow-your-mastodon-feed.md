One of the many brilliant things about [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) is that it lets you follow your Twitter stream as an RSS feed (thereby giving you all the tweets with none of the replies, retweets, likes, views and general noise) As Mastodon is essentially the same thing, albeit federated and _sans_ billionaire overlord, it’d be great if NNW offered a Mastodon to RSS service.

I’ve raised an issue on Github, if you’re interested:
