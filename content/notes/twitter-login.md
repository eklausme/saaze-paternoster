Twitter often changes its website login UI. Most of the time it seems to be A/B testing different approaches, which is standard enough. However, recently there’s been some [dark pattern](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) stuff going on:

Obviously, this is nudging users to sign up – or even login – with a third party account (Google, Apple but not Facebook, natch) by placing the native login link at the bottom of the list, and not annointing it with an icon. Why? In the interests of convenience?
