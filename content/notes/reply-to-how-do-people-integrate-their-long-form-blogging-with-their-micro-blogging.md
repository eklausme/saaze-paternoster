(Reply to How do people integrate their long form blogging with their micro blogging?)

Itâ€™s all one website with 3 types of posts (longer form posts, links and notes â€“ which are the microblogs). I autopost to micro.blog and Mastodon and pick up any replies on my site with Bridgy and webmention.io

It helps if you can tailor your RSS feeds for each platform ðŸ™‚
