Netlify has some really nice – and free – plugins (look under the Integrations menu). Includes [Webmentions](https://github.com/CodeFoodPixels/netlify-plugin-webmentions#readme), which sends outbound webmentions automatically, and a [Jekyll Cache](https://github.com/Mesomorphic/netlify-plugin-jekyll-cache#readme) plugin that should shave some seconds off build minutes.
