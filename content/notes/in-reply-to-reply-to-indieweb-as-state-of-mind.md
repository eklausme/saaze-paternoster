[Jessica is right](https://www.jayeless.net/2021/09/7z4xk.html). For example, this exchange would be a _lot_ easier on micro.blog (or Twitter, for that matter) 😃

Another obvious limitation to funelling everything through your site is that they’re not built for actual back and forth conversations. It’s like posting declamations to church doors – which suits a certain style of writing (which I like, incidentally) – and waiting for a messenger to inform you of what’s been said. Like in Shakespeare, the messenger often doesn’t make it.

Also – I’m not sure if I’m addressing Jessica directly, or my general “audience” (if that’s not too grandiose a term for it).
