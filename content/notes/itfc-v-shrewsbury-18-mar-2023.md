Quick #ITFC v Shrewsbury review: We were superb today, and it was only 2-0 because Shrewsbury are a really well-organised team. Good North Stand atmosphere, Iâ€™m 100% behind the effort to repurpose the Chris Kiwomya song for Massimo Luongo. The Darren Huckerby song got an unexpected but welcome airing.

PotM: probably Wes Burns, but Luongo, Morsy and Broadhead were very good too. In this form weâ€™ll make automatic promotion ðŸ’ª
