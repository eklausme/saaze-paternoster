Website plans for the weekend: Sort out webmentions so likes and reshares are displayed simply as an icon (they appear as normal comments at the mo).

Also: continue to post to the website rather than direct to Mastodon (i.e. #POSSE) I like Mastodon but itâ€™s a complete time sink; no good for me, just like Twitter in lockdown.
