“Bed wet good grief. Good grief bed wet.” — DEDICATION NOT MEDICATION

I like this heavy metal incarnation of the group; it complements Mark’s deteriorating health and the insane gargling singing voice he developed. Illness is a major theme of his lyrics from 2010 (and there’s a fair bit before that). Sub-lingual tablet is hard, dedicated listening – and pays off, of course.

Why is Pierce Brosnan prescribing pills that cause/cure bedwetting?
