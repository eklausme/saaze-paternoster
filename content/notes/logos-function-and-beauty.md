Yesterday I read these two opinions on placing a logo in the top left hand corner of your web page:

> *Keep it simple*. A principle as true in typography as anything else. If you think you need three colors and five fonts, think again. If you think you need a logo in the upper left corner of every page, think again. <cite>[Maxims of page layout, Matthew Butterick](https://practicaltypography.com/maxims-of-page-layout.html)</cite>

> *Where things will be located on a page*. For example, users expect the logo identifying the site to be in the top left corner (at least in countries where reading is left to right)… <cite>Don’t Make Me Think Revisited p.30, 3rd ed. 2013, Steve Krug</cite>

They aren’t mutually exclusive – Krug is discussing how to make corporate sites usable, Butterick on writing long form, more personal texts, such as a blog. Where the two approaches to design – namely function and delight – meet and relate is an interesting area. (The apparent dichotomy is as old as the hills.)

Note: Butterick is preaching simplicity, which aids usability, and Krug has added “delightful” as a possible attribute of usability <cite>passim, p.9</cite>.
