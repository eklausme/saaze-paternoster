I’m nearly at the point where I’m going to shift this website from Jekyll to WordPress. No small thing! [I made the reverse move 10 years ago](../../posts/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/), and I’ve spent that decade [tinkering with the damn thing](../../posts/using-welcomments-for-a-static-jekyll-powered-site/). The final decision is whether I want to keep it static (allow me a small bit of tinkering, yeah?) or just have a normal WordPress install. Static = cheap, fast, stable, but sans comments and webmentions.
