Iâ€™m on quite a blogging roll since I started using Jekyll how it was intended â€“ i.e. for publishing articles <i>sans</i> comments, webmentions etc. I seem to have settled on the 3-500 word post, which is an inbetween sort of length. Consequently, Iâ€™m posting more posts than notes ðŸ¤”

Iâ€™ve got an idea for a book as well.
