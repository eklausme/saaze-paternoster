Right, I’ve got most the #webmention work done on https://www.thisdaysportion.com They’re now split into links, likes, reposts and replies (I think that covers everything), and displayed as icons linking out to whatever sent the mention. Todo: tidy up the code that grabs webmentions from webmention.io and (probably) make replies appear as, erm, replies.
