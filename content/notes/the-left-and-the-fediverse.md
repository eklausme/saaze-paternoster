Slightly baffled by some of the UK left’s attitude to Mastodon. A single, privately-owned service is inherently hostile to the left: Twitter’s value lies in networking and dissemination, not as a place to engage in “discussion” with other views (AKA the marketplace of ideas).

You can network — and more! — by setting up, say, a Novara instance.
