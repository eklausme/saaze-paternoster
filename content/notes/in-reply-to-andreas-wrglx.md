I still have a webmention.io endpoint, so if you do send a webmention to my site I’ll pick it up. I like the idea of not providing a link in the visible text in my reply, so it’ll either not make sense to anybody except the replyee, or it’ll also have to make sense out of context. Like this.

And thanks 👍
