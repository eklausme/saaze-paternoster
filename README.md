# Example theme for Simplified Saaze

Here is another theme called [Paternoster](https://eklausmeier.goip.de/paternoster) for [_Simplified Saaze_](https://eklausmeier.goip.de/blog/2021/10-31-simplified-saaze). The example content is from [Leon Paternoster](http://www.thisdaysportion.com).

Some key features:
1. Multiblog: 3 different blog types, i.e., one classical blog, one Twitter like blog, one link-collection blog
2. Lightweight as there are no gimmicks, no social media icons, no categories+tags, no dark theme switcher
3. Fully responsive with media breaks at 20em, 40em, 100em, and an extra one for paper-print.
4. Easy to amend a commenting system, see for example [HashOver](https://eklausmeier.goip.de/blog/2022/01-04-hashover-comment-system-with-hiawatha).

# Simplified Saaze

_Simplified Saaze_ is a fast, all-inclusive, flat-file CMS for simple websites and blogs.

Static site builders are fast but normally have a steep learning curve and require lots of tooling to make them work. We believe building a personal site should be stupidly simple. That's why _Simplified Saaze_ is built on the following principles.

* Easy to run - All you need is PHP8, a C compiler, and Composer
* Easy to host - Serve dynamically or statically
* Easy to edit - Edit content using simple Markdown files
* Easy to theme - Templates use plain PHP/HTML
* Fast and secure - No database = less moving parts + more speed
* Simple to understand - Everything is a collection of entries

For more info and documentation for the original Saaze see https://saaze.dev. Read [_Simplified Saaze_](https://eklausmeier.goip.de/blog/2021/10-31-simplified-saaze) for installation and usage.
